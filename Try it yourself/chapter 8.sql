-- 1. We saw that library visits have declined in most places. But what is the
-- pattern in the use of technology in libraries? Both the 2014 and 2009 library
-- survey tables contain the columns gpterms (the number of internet-connected
-- computers used by the public) and pitusr (uses of public internet computers
-- per year). Modify the code in Listing 8-13 to calculate the percent change in
-- the sum of each column over time. Watch out for negative values!

       sum(pls14.gpterms) AS gpterms_2014,

       round( (CAST(sum(pls14.gpterms) AS decimal(10,1)) - sum(pls09.gpterms)) /

-- The query results show a consistent increase in the number of internet

-- add percent change, and sort.

-- The query results show most states have seen a decrease in the total uses
-- of public internet computers per year.

-- 2. Both library survey tables contain a column called obereg, a two-digit
-- Bureau of Economic Analysis Code that classifies each library agency
-- according to a region of the United States, such as New England, Rocky
-- Mountains, and so on. Just as we calculated the percent change in visits
-- grouped by state, do the same to group percent changes in visits by US
-- regions using obereg. Consult the survey documentation to find the meaning
-- of each region code. For a bonus challenge, create a table with the obereg
-- code as the primary key and the region name as text, and join it to the
-- summary query to group by the region name rather than the code.

-- 3. Thinking back to the types of joins you learned in Chapter 6, which join
-- type will show you all the rows in both tables, including those without a
-- match? Write such a query and add an IS NULL filter in a WHERE clause to
-- show agencies not included in one or the other table.
-- FULL OUTER JOIN will show all rows in both tables.
